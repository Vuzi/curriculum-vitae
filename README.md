My curriculum vitae !

## PDF Version
Open with chrome, and choose to print the webpage as a PDF.

## Note
To be opened locally, you'll need to disable cross origin request (because https and file are mixed), for example on Chrome :

```
chrome --user-data-dir="./working-dir" --disable-web-security
```
